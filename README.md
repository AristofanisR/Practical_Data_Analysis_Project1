## Abstract

**Purpose**: This exploratory study examines the effects of environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind, and air quality on marathon performance. Specifically, it explores how these conditions influence performance across different ages and genders, and identifies the weather parameters with the most significant impact on performance outcomes.

**Methods**: Data from five major marathons over a 15-20 year period, covering ages 14 to 85, were analyzed. Environmental conditions such as temperature (°C), humidity (%), wind speed (km/hr), WBGT (°C) and others were recorded. Performance was measured based on finish times, and exploratory analyses were conducted to identify the relationship between weather conditions and race performance.

**Results**: Exploratory analyses indicate that Solar Radiation and some pollutants in the air have the greatest influence on marathon performance. Older runners and children (mostly female athletes) showed greater sensitivity to environmental conditions, leading to slower finish times compared to middle aged male participants.

**Conclusions**: Environmental factors, particularly air quality (some pollutants in the air) and solar radiation, play a critical role in marathon performance. Those findings can help inform runners and organizers about the potential impacts of weather on race outcomes and guide race-day decisions.
